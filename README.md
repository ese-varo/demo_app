## Company administrator app

Once you sign up into the app you are able to Add branches of your company and capture the employees for each branch. CRUD operations can be implemented on each of both resources (company branches and employees). Bootstrap is used to deal with the front-end. The database schema is implemented using active record associations on mysql for development environment and postgresql at production. The app was deployed to heroku. You can see it [here](https://proyekt.herokuapp.com).
